                    <p>
                      This is your ticket to an exclusive gang with events all around the world every month. Networking, business ventures and the greatest parties to celebrate the gang.
                      <br>
                      Welcome to the strongest and most exclusive club in the metaverse.Not everyone may be a good fit for the gang.
                      <br>
                      If you are not, members of the gang have the right to a vote. The results of such a vote can lead to the members to force you to sell your membership at fair market value + 15%.
                      <br>
                      If you buy a Suicide Gangster NFT and cannot crack the codes, you will not be receiving any invitation to gang activity.
                      <br>
                      Each NFT you hold is a vote in the gang and a gang constitution will be written once initial members have entered and been accepted.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Thanks to @True_NFTs who believed and backed our project, we have access to the resources to make our dreams possible.
                      <br>
                      We have raised XX,XXX SOL + all revenue from sales to make the dreams and visions of the gang become a reality. The total amount of SOL owned by the gang is in the 5 figure range. The official amount will be kept private from the public and only disclosed to members who make it in the gang.
                      The Suicide Gang will NOT have any website or social media accounts after our awareness campaign has been completed. Gang activity, news and events will not be open information to the public.
                      <br>
                      We will move the official members (holders of Suicide Gangster NFT) of our gang away from the discord server with everyone else to a secret location where only holders will be given and can maintain access.
                      <br>
                      Any information released to the public will only come from

                    <h3>ROAD MAP</h3>
                    <p>
                      Ⅰ - Drop NFTs - The Suicide Gangsters will be released from the meta villains. They will be beat up, exhausted and injected with a memory erasing virus... It is up to you, the holder, and only you, to crack the codes in order to regenerate your gangster’s memory. 🖖🤟🧠
                      <br>
                      Ⅱ - Once all 10K codes have been cracked, we will instantly air drop all owners a free add-on which will regenerate your Gangster’s memory and will contain clues regarding the Gang’s reunion 🖖🤟🔍
                      <br>
                      Ⅲ - Being a holder of a Suicide Gang NFT, makes you an official member of the  Suicide Gang and also a TrueNFTs benefits member. This includes early access rights to drops, merch and TrueNFTs upcoming celebrity artist collabs. TrueNFTs is the sponsor of our project and we couldn't have done this without them 🖖🤟✅
                      <br>
                      Ⅳ - Private exclusive gang parties and networking events every month all around the globe. At these events, the community will be able to discuss and vote on the future of the project and see what bad ass gang activity we’ll do next! All gang reunion locations will be voted by the community and invitations will be airdropped to holders. Free NFT giveaways, gang celebrations and much more. Can’t wait to see you there 🖖🤟🥳
                      <br>
                      Ⅴ - Expand team, hire more developers and designers. Possibly hire from the community if talent is there.🖖🤟📈
                      <br>
                      Ⅵ - Voted upon the community! The Lost Suicide gang is completely decentralized and the direction of the gang will be voted amongst its members. Where will the gang go? We have the whole Solana chain and the outside world to explore. Thanks to @True_NFTs we have the support we need to build and do what the gang votes on 🖖🤟💯
                      <br>
                      Ⅶ - Most importantly, by purchasing a Suicide Gangster NFT you are entering a gang. Be sure to read the 🚨🚨read-me🚨🚨 channel and understand EVERYTHING before getting yourself into something you may not desire...
